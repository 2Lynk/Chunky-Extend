# Chunky-extended (Ce)
## An extension for Chunky (fabric)
This mod is intended for servers that a running many mods or mods that impact world generation.
If running Chunky is causing the server to lag and cause the server to run ticks behind then this mod is for you.

When enabled this mod will check if the last player left the server and then start Chunky, when someone joins it will pause Chunky.
This means you can configure Chunky and run it without having to worry about causing server lag to players when you have a server with many mods.
